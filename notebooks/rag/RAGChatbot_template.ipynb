    "# 🔍 Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will introduce you to Retrieval Augmented Generation and how it can be used to expand the knowledge base of an existing pretrained LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🧠Glossary:\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to be using some rather fancy sounding words that you may not have come across before. I'd highly reccommend googling them, but feel free to refer to this cheat sheet if you forget.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Vector: Think of this as a list of numbers specifically used to represent co-ordinates. So a vector containing the co-ordinates to a point at (2,8) would be [2, 8]. Now we'll often be using arrays of vectors, we'll also be using a library called numpy, which supports 2D arrays (basically an array of arrays) much better than regular Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   Embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   A huge part of RAG is semantic search (i.e. searching by meaning). This is the core of what makes RAG so powerful, as it can tell us how similar two sentences are based on what they mean, even if they are worded differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The way this is done is by using an embedding model to convert text (or images) to points in space. The closer two points are, the closer in meaning their corresponding texts are.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   We will be storing the co-ordinates of the points in vectors, hence the need for a vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Note: While it is helpful to think of the points generated by an embedding model as points in 3 dimensions, most embedding models generate points in higher dimensions; the model we are using generates points in 384 dimensions! So instead of our points having an x, y and z co-ordinate, they will have x, y, z, w, v,..... co-odinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. LLM: Large Language Models (LLM) can generate text based on a provided prompt. Sound familiar? It should; ChatGPT is a Large Language Model! We'll be using an LLM to actually answer a users question. The problem here is that LLMs aren't all knowing; they can only answer questions based on what they've been trained on. A way to remedy this is to use techniques like RAG to work out what snippets of text from an external source are most similar to the users question and feeding them to the LLM along with the users question. The LLM can use this data to generate a natural sounding answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Chunks:\n",
    "* A chunk is simply a smaller piece of a larger piece of text. The reason you'd want to break down, say, a book or a pdf is to find relevant pieces of information in it. After all, we don't want to throw an entire PDF at our LLM and have it decipher all of it, now do we?\n",
    "\n",
    "* We'll use a bunch of functions that we'll get to later to work out which chunks are the most relevant to our question and pass just those to our LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The size of a chunk is entirely up to the programmer, but you want a chunk to be big enough for it to actually have some sort of meaning in it on its own, while not being big enought to contain too many different kinds of information in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 📌 What You'll Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Create a rudimentary vector database by defining the functions in the template class below\n",
    "2.   Convert a pdf of a stock trading tutorial to a bunch of small strings (called chunks. we'll get to why later).\n",
    "3.   Use this vector database to store the embeddings of the chunks.\n",
    "4. Handle user queries by querying our database for the most relevant chunks and feeding them to our LLM to generate an output."
